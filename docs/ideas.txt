 - Add support for redundancy across multiple clusters or datacenters

 - Add a state persistence layer so that individual nodes retain their state
   regardless of conditionals configured on the node

 - Allow perturbation runs to be paused and stepped through. On each step it
   would be nice if the state graph were displayed.

 - Stop running simulation when no more attractors are discovered
