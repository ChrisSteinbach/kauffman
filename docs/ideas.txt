 - Stop running simulation when no more attractors are discovered

 - Add support for redundancy across multiple clusters or datacenters

 - Improve the attractor diagram. Show surviving nodes of the state only (i.e.
   the residue), and transitions between states?

 - Produce a "nonfunctional requirements" table

 - Produce a incidence matrix

 - Find a way to model openshift, perhaps with CPU, Memory and Disk as nodes
   that can be placed as dependencies
