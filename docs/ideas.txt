 - Add a state persistence layer so that individual nodes retain their state
   regardless of conditionals configured on the node

 - Allow perturbation runs to be paused and stepped through. On each step it
   would be nice if the state graph were displayed.

 - Stop running simulation when no more attractors are discovered

 - Add support for redundancy across multiple clusters or datacenters

 - Produce a "nonfunctional requirements" table

 - Produce a incidence matrix based on detected attractors

 - Find a way to model openshift, perhaps with CPU, Memory and Disk as nodes
   that can be placed as dependencies

 - Improve the attractor diagram. Show surviving nodes of the state only (i.e.
   the residue), and transitions between states?
