 - Add functions that can act on modulo partitioned groups of nodes

 - Use title from graphviz graph in output

 - Create a network loader class that partitions all the graphviz stuff from
   the rest of the code.

 - Start perturbations off all green and add a randomize function instead.

 - Allow perturbation runs to be paused and stepped through. On each step it
   would be nice if the state graph were displayed, perhaps in another tmux
   pane

 - Stop running simulation when no more attractors are discovered
