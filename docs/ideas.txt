 - Add support for redundancy across multiple clusters or datacenters

 - For perturbations, add a state persistence layer so that individual nodes
   retain their state regardless of conditionals configured on the node

 - Allow perturbation runs to be paused and stepped through. On each step it
   would be nice if the state graph were displayed, perhaps in another tmux
   pane

 - Stop running simulation when no more attractors are discovered
