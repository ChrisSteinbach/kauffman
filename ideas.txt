 - Using a threshold instead of a percentage so that a node-type is either up
   or down depending on how many pods are up. Minio, for example, needs over 50%
   of pods available. Others may be considered "up" with only one pod available.

 - Improve the attractor diagram. Show surviving nodes of the state only (i.e.
   the residue), and transitions between states?

 - Produce a "nonfunctional requirements" table

 - Produce a incidence matrix

 - Find a way to model openshift, perhaps with CPU, Memory and Disk as nodes
   that can be placed as dependencies

 - Should remove Health nodes from attractor sequence
