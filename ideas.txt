Should speed up attractor detection. Consider:
 1) Using a threshold instead of a percentage so that a node-type is either up
    or down depending on how many pods are up. Minio, for example, needs over 50%
    of pods available. Others may be considered "up" with only one pod available.
 2) Instead of the above, using a tuple, (node_type, percentage) and stop
    keying on strings

 - Improve the attractor diagram. Show surviving nodes of the state only (i.e.
   the residue), and transitions between states.

 - Produce a "nonfunctional requirements" table

 - Produce a incidence matrix

 - Find a way to model openshift, perhaps with CPU, Memory and Disk as nodes
   that can be placed as dependencies

 - Should remove Health nodes from attractor sequence
