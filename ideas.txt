Modularize the code and create unit tests
Produce a "nonfunctional requirements" table
Allow more than one architecture to be processed to allow side-by-side comparison
Create a web-based interface where either the diagram can be created or pasted and the results shown as a diagram in the browser
Find a way to model openshift, perhaps with CPU, Memory and Disk as nodes that can be placed as dependencies

Minio Frontend nodes are probably uneavenly mapped. Storage Gateway and Ingester probably map to the same nodes.

Action: find a way to always add mappings to the target node with the least connections

Should remove Health nodes from attractor sequence
Should speed up attractor detection. Consider:
 1) Using a threshold instead of a percentage so that a node-type is either up or down depending
    on how many pods are up. Minio, for example, needs over 50% of pods available. Others may be
    considered "up" with only one pod available.
 2) Instead of the above, using a tuple, (node_type, percentage) and stop keying on strings


Introduce pertubations during attractor cycling

Count non-attractor runs
